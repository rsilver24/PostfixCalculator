Postfix Calculator is meant to make use of our previously coded StackNode and Stack classes to do what a normal calculator can do. The main difference is that instead of taking an equation as 1 + 1 = 2, as 1 1 + and it will spit out 2. This project consists of three primary Java files Postfix.java, Stack.java, and StackNode.java. Postfix contains all the code for the calculator itself consisting of 6 methods. A method named postfixCalculation completes the required action: Takes User Input, Calculates it, and Displays it. A method named compile does the actual calculation with/ both Stack management and Function Procedures and four methods that are in charge of multiplying, subtracting, adding, and subtracting. Stack class is meant to take a series of data and organize it in a "stack" structure, not all too different from an ArrayList java class.
